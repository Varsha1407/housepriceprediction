# housepriceprediction
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting house prices using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. The model leverages historical data on house sales, including features such as size, number of bedrooms, location, etc., to predict the sale price of houses.

Project Structure
Data Acquisition: Obtain the dataset containing historical house prices and features.
Data Preprocessing: Clean, transform, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Development: Select a regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision trees) and train the model using scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and R2 score.
